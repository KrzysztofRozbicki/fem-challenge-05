## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to put the responsive scroll/background images as :after objects to the elements.
Now I know to create adaptive flex with constant positioning of its child content. It was a good
lesson what mistakes I have to avoid in order to prepare responsive layout for horizontal view on
smartphones. All together it was a good learning experience with focus on adaptive and responsive
positioning.

### Continued development

I would like to discover new ways of positioning the background decorative elements in fully
responsive and dynamic way.
